Drag Drop Visual Formula engine
=====================
A drag drop formula engine built on JavaScript, DOM Scripting and minimal jQuery, from the days before HTML5
_Essentially_ Single page app with rich animations and feedbacks

- Helps create formulae visually
- Create and save (needs PHP with file write) mathematical formulae, set values in single page forms
- Drag and drop operators (plus, minus, brackets, divide, etc.)
- Complex operators and form values preserved post drag drop
